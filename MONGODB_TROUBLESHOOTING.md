# MongoDB Atlas Authentication Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## üîç Problem Analysis
You're getting the error: `bad auth : authentication failed`

This typically means one of these issues:
1. **Wrong credentials** (username/password)
2. **Missing database name** in the URI
3. **Incorrect user permissions** in MongoDB Atlas
4. **Network access restrictions**

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Solution

### 1. Verify Your MongoDB Atlas Configuration

#### A. Check Database User
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Navigate to **Database Access** in your project
3. Verify that user `23202001` exists
4. Check that the password is `23202001`
5. **IMPORTANT**: Ensure the user has `readWrite` role for the `miau_store` database

#### B. Check Network Access
1. Go to **Network Access** in MongoDB Atlas
2. Add IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0` (allows access from anywhere)
3. Or add your specific IP address if you prefer

#### C. Verify Cluster Status
1. Go to **Database** (Clusters)
2. Ensure your cluster `cluster0` is running
3. Verify the connection string matches: `cluster0.vgypvgq.mongodb.net`

### 2. Test Your Connection

Run the connection test script:
```bash
node test-connection.js
```

This will:
- Test the MongoDB connection
- Show detailed error messages
- Verify database operations work
- Provide specific troubleshooting steps

### 3. Correct URI Format

Your URI should be:
```
mongodb+srv://23202001:23202001@cluster0.vgypvgq.mongodb.net/miau_store?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

**Key components:**
- `23202001:23202001` - username:password
- `cluster0.vgypvgq.mongodb.net` - your cluster hostname
- `/miau_store` - **CRITICAL**: database name must be included
- Query parameters for connection options

### 4. Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "authentication failed"
**Solution:**
- Double-check username and password in MongoDB Atlas
- Ensure user has `readWrite` role on `miau_store` database
- Make sure database name is in the URI

#### Issue: "IP not in whitelist"
**Solution:**
- Add `0.0.0.0/0` to Network Access in MongoDB Atlas
- Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to take effect

#### Issue: "ENOTFOUND"
**Solution:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify cluster hostname is correct
- Ensure cluster is running

### 5. MongoDB Atlas User Setup (If needed)

If you need to recreate the user:

1. **Delete existing user** (if any issues)
2. **Create new user:**
   - Username: `23202001`
   - Password: `23202001`
   - Database User Privileges: `readWrite` on `miau_store`
3. **Save and wait** 1-2 minutes for propagation

### 6. Environment Variables

Make sure your environment has:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://23202001:23202001@cluster0.vgypvgq.mongodb.net/miau_store?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### 7. Testing Steps

1. **Test connection locally:**
   ```bash
   node test-connection.js
   ```

2. **Run your server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Check logs** for successful connection message

## üö® Emergency Checklist

If still having issues, verify ALL of these:

- [ ] User `23202001` exists in Database Access
- [ ] Password is exactly `23202001`
- [ ] User has `readWrite` role for `miau_store` database
- [ ] Network Access includes `0.0.0.0/0`
- [ ] Cluster `cluster0` is running
- [ ] URI includes `/miau_store` database name
- [ ] No typos in cluster hostname: `cluster0.vgypvgq.mongodb.net`
- [ ] Waited 1-2 minutes after making Atlas changes

## üìû Still Need Help?

If the issue persists:
1. Run `node test-connection.js` and share the output
2. Screenshot your MongoDB Atlas Database Access settings
3. Screenshot your MongoDB Atlas Network Access settings
4. Verify your cluster is in the correct region and running

The most common cause is missing database name in URI or incorrect user permissions!
